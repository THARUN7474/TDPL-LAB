Yes, the code implements a **round-robin ticket assignment algorithm** as part of the automated ticket routing process. Here's a more detailed explanation of how it works:

### Round-Robin Ticket Assignment Algorithm

1. **Agent Array Initialization**:
   - The system initializes an array of agents (`agents[MAX_AGENTS]`). Each agent has an ID, a name, and an availability status (`available`).

2. **Next Agent Index**:
   - The `nextAgentIndex` variable keeps track of which agent should be assigned the next ticket. This ensures that tickets are distributed evenly among all agents.

3. **Assign Ticket to Agent**:
   - When a new ticket is created, the `assignTicketToAgent` function assigns the ticket to the agent at `nextAgentIndex`.
   - After assigning the ticket, the agent's `available` status is set to `0` (busy), and `nextAgentIndex` is incremented.
   - If `nextAgentIndex` exceeds the number of agents, it resets to `0`, starting the round-robin cycle again.

Hereâ€™s the specific part of the code that implements the round-robin ticket assignment:

```c
void assignTicketToAgent(int ticketIndex) {
    if (nextAgentIndex >= MAX_AGENTS) {
        nextAgentIndex = 0;  // Reset to start the round-robin cycle
    }
    
    int assignedAgent = nextAgentIndex;  // Get the next agent in the round-robin cycle
    tickets[ticketIndex].agentId = agents[assignedAgent].id;  // Assign the ticket to this agent
    strcpy(tickets[ticketIndex].status, "Assigned");  // Update ticket status
    agents[assignedAgent].available = 0;  // Mark the agent as busy
    
    printf("Ticket ID %d assigned to %s.\n", tickets[ticketIndex].id, agents[assignedAgent].name);
    
    nextAgentIndex++;  // Move to the next agent for future assignments
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Round-Robin Assignment**: Ensures that all agents get an equal number of tickets over time by cycling through the list of agents in order.
- **Automatic Assignment**: When a ticket is created, it is automatically assigned to an agent without any manual intervention.
- **Agent Availability**: The system tracks agent availability, marking them as busy when assigned a ticket.

This round-robin approach is simple but effective for evenly distributing workload among agents in a support system.
