Imperative programming languages are a category of programming languages that focus on explicitly telling the computer *how* to perform tasks through a sequence of instructions. These instructions change the program's state, typically involving operations like assigning values to variables, controlling the flow of execution using loops and conditionals, and manipulating data structures.

### Characteristics of Imperative Languages:
- **Explicit Commands:** Programs consist of commands for the computer to perform, usually in a specific order.
- **State Changes:** Imperative programming emphasizes the concept of program state, which can be modified by the program's instructions.
- **Sequential Execution:** Code is typically executed in a linear, top-to-bottom order, although flow control structures like loops and conditionals can alter this sequence.
- **Memory Management:** The programmer often has to manage memory and state changes directly.

### Examples of Pure Imperative Languages:
- **C:** A widely-used system programming language that strictly follows the imperative paradigm.
- **Assembly Language:** The lowest-level human-readable programming language, directly manipulating hardware through instructions.
- **Fortran (earlier versions):** Especially Fortran 77 and earlier versions, which are imperative without object-oriented features.

### Tasks in a Pure Imperative Language
If you need to implement tasks in a pure imperative language, you might consider using C, as it strictly adheres to the imperative paradigm without involving object-oriented, functional, or concurrent programming concepts.
